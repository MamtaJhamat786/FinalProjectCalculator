# FinalProjectCalculator
I am going to develop Calculator app with additional features like power[for example (10^5)], performing more than one fuction like addition, subtraction and division
at the same time for example:4+8=12/4=3-2=1, π function (4 * π ), factorial (5 !)some trignometry functions like sin, cos, tan and log function rather than just
performing addition, subtraction, multiplication and division individually like (4+5) or (5*5) etc. I am making calculator app so that i can learn more about 
functionalities, how it works and whats the logic behind that particular functionality. I am going to use java in android studio as i am comfortable in java and i
have already studied java in another course AND firebase as a backend as Firebase provides different functionalities like realtime database, authentication, cloud
Messaging, cloud storage and many others as well. The Firebase Realtime Database is a cloud- hosted database. Data is stored as JSON and synchronized in realtime to
every connected client. When we build cross-platform apps with our iOS, Android, and JavaScript SDKs, all of your clients share one Realtime Database instance and
automatically receive updates with the newest data. The Firebase SDKs for Cloud Storage adds Google security to file uploads and downloads for our Firebase apps,
regardless of network quality. We can use firebase SDKs to store images, audio, video, or other user- generated content. My plan for next two weaks is to create half 
of the functionalities and all the design.
